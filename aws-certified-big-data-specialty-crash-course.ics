DESCRIPTION:In this online course\, Noah Gift will cover how to prepare fo
 r one of the hottest certification exams in 2019\, the AWS Big Data Certif
 ication.  This training will cover the six core areas of the certification
 :  Collection\, Storage\, Processing\, Analysis\, Visualization\, and Data
  Security.  The final portion of the course will cover real-world case stu
 dies of Big Data problems on AWS.\n\nData Science is one of the hottest jo
 bs\, but it is often said that you need five data engineers to support one
  data scientist.  The reason for this metric is that data engineering is a
  challenging job that requires cutting edge skills that are often platform
  specific.  This course helps data engineers round out their knowledge of 
 AWS Big Data fundamentals so they can achieve certification on the AWS pla
 tform.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the event (https://learning.oreilly.com/live-trainin
